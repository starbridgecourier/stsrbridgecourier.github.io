Notes:
- Images used are linked from Unsplash (royalty-free). If you want local copies instead, replace image URLs with files placed in /images and upload them.
- Replace images/logo.svg with your official PNG/SVG logo (same filename) to show your real logo.
- For a web-based contact form, consider Netlify Forms or Formspree (I can set that up free on request).
